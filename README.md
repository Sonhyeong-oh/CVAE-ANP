# Code Description

1. ANP: Probabilistic time-series modeling for high-frequency sensor data prediction.

2. VAE: High-level visual feature extraction and latent representation of process images.

3. grad-CAM: Visual explanation and evidence localization for anomaly detection via Grad-CAM & Eigen-CAM.

4. train: Multimodal fusion and joint training using visual and sensor information for VAE-ANP combined model.

5. XAI_test: Anomaly detection evaluation and automated root cause analysis.
